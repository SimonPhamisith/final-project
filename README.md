# Japan Tourism ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
Welcome to my final project for the Concordia University bootcamp! As a huge fan of traveling and the Japanese culture, I've dedicated this project on the tourism in Japan. We're going to talk about events that have possibly impacted the amount of tourists per year, from which countries specifically are they from, the seasonal trends that could affect them whether or not it would be a busy time or not and much more! If you are thinking of visiting the country, I hope this project helps you find the perfect time to visit! 

# Data Sources
Most of the datasets that I've acquired and used are from the Japan National Tourism Organization(JNTO): https://statistics.jnto.go.jp/en/
I've also found a dataset from World Bank: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.ARVL?locations=JP

# Tools
- python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly
- seaborn
- numpy
  
# Visualization/interactive
I used streamlit to make a simple and easy to understand application where all the graphs that I've plotted are included.
you will see:
- Visitor arrivals over time
- Visitors per prefecture
- Arrivals per country
- Key events
- Purpose of visits

# Conclusion
I hope this project helps informing others of the tourism in Japan as well as help them with poossibly finding the perfect time to visit.
